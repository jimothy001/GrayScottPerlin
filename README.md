# GrayScott + Perlin Noise
RD subjected to external forces

Experiment to see what happens with RD when it is subjected to directional biases (currents), as produced by a vector field.

The effect of the vector field is most apparent at vector singularities.

In addition to 'painting' more solution B into soution A, are able to experiment with different parameters for perlin vectors, reaction diffusion, and paint brush size.
